# TODO

## Core

- Download Games inside Battlenet

- Download Games inside Epic Games

## UI
- V.1 of GUI 

## Users
- Login / Users

- Store a library of installed games

## UI
- V.2 of GUI

## Custom scripts
- Be able to run custom scripts to download games outside of pre-defined launchers

- Allow for custom scripts to be run when game launches

## Extra features (Not necessarily coming, but rather things I want to impliment.)
- Set custom thumbnails, banners and backgrounds for games, such as images, gifs or videos

- Friend system to allow players to be friends and if possible play together across 'platforms' (ex. Steam + Epic)

- Seup a store, where publishers can either self-host the games to download or if this project raises enough money, host on Monarch.
